# Coding
'''
Today i have created a basic level of calculator
This calculator have basic math operations
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
'''
#I have using hashtag operation to revise my previous lecture
print("Addition, (+)")  
print("Subtraction, (-)")
print("Multiplication, (*)")
print("Division, (/)")
print("Moudulo, (%)")
print("expoenial, (**)")
#Lets using some values 
a=9
b=4
#Now lets print the results
print("adittion of a and b is ", a+b)
print("subtraction of a and b is ", a-b)
print("multiplication of a and b is", a*b)
print("division of a and b is", a/b)
print("modulo of a and b is", a//b)
print("expoenial of a and b is", a**b)
#First excerice i have performed on replit /n using some comments also
#I want to add few things which i have learn from lectures
print("comment, Escape Sequence, variable and data types")
print("we use escape sequence for various purpose")
print("for the new line we use back slash with n", "/n")
print("for the double code backward slash with double code \"we use\"")
print("for the memorize of statement and donot want in a code run we use comment")
print("comments includes", "# and ***")
#Few things on print statement
print("print statement is also used for multiple types")
print("Hey Guys", 6, 7, sep="~", end="009/n")
print("Variables are used to store data")
print("Above values A=9 and B=4 are variables")
print("Data type are 4 types")
a=12
b="Muaz"
c=True
d=None
print("a is, a")
print("b is, b")
print("c is, c")
print("d is, d")
#integers
#floats
